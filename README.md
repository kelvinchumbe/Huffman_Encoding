# Huffman_Encoding
Huffman Encoding algorithm with a tree data structure and arraylist of nodes (alternative to a minimum heap)

The Tester class reads a message and generates a frequency table. From the frequency table, a code table is generated and the message is encoded. The message can then be decoded using the same frequency table. The decoder can decode any encoded message that has been encoded using the same frequency table
